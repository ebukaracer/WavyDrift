# WavyDrift
*A simple mobile flappy-style game I developed using Unity.*

## Features:
- Save System
- Audio Manager
- InGame Shop

## Download:
Download the Windows build [here]()

## Notes:
âš  This `branch` isn't well optmized for mobile devices, since it's missing `object-pooling` for instantiating and destroying objects. Meanwhile, It can be played on windows, most likely all logic implemented [here](https://github.com/ebukaracer/WavyDrift) but `object-pooling` are also implemented here.
