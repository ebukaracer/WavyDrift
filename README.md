# WavyDrift
*A simple mobile flappy-style game I developed using Unity.*

## Features:
- Save System
- Audio Manager
- InGame Shop
- Post-Processing

## Download:
`Working on it...`

## Notes:
âš  This `branch` isn't well optmized for android platform, since it's missing `object-pooling` for instantiating and destroying objects. Meanwhile, It can be played on windows or webgl platform, most likely all logic implemented [here](https://github.com/ebukaracer/WavyDrift) but `object-pooling` are also implemented here.
