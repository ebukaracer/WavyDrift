# WavyDrift
*A simple flappy-style game I developed using Unity.*

## Notes:
âš  This `branch` isn't well optimized for android platform, since it's missing `object-pooling` for instantiating and destroying objects. Meanwhile, It can be deployed on Windows or Webgl platform, most likely all features implemented [here](https://github.com/ebukaracer/WavyDrift) but `object-pooling` are also implemented here. Currently, this `branch` isn't built for any platform yet.

## Features:
- Save System/Save Manager
- Audio Manager
- In-Game Shop
- Ads
- Post-Processing
